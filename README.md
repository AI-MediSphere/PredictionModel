## Project Overview
The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction AI project is an open-source initiative aimed at developing an AI-powered chatbot that predicts the probability of an individual having a cardiovascular disease based on user-provided inputs. The project utilizes machine learning techniques and a pre-trained model to provide users with an estimate of their likelihood of developing a cardiovascular disease in the present or future.

The motivation behind this project is to address the significant impact of heart diseases, which rank among the top three causes of death worldwide. Often, patients realize the presence of cardiovascular diseases at a late stage, resulting in limited treatment options. The project aims to empower users to self-assess their risk and make informed decisions about seeking medical checkups and interventions.

## Technology Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies:
AWS (Amazon Web Services): Cloud infrastructure and services
Python: Programming language for machine learning and data processing

## Installation

To run the Cardiovascular Disease Prediction AI project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git
  cd my-project
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git
  cd my-project
```
3. Run the AI chatbot using the provided command-line interface (CLI) or by integrating the API into your own application.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Demo

The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction AI project offers two main ways to interact with the prediction model:

1. Command-line Interface (CLI): Run the project locally on your machine and use the CLI to provide inputs and obtain predictions.

```bash
  python src/chatbot.py
```

2. API Integration: Integrate the provided API endpoints into your own application to interact with the prediction model programmatically.

```bash
import requests
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/predict", json={"input": "user-input-data"})
prediction = response.json()["prediction"]

```

Please refer to the project's API documentation (API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for more details on the available endpoints and input/output formats.
